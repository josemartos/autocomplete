# autocomplete

Plain JavaScript autocomplete with some ES6 sugar

## description

Created for testing purposes. The auto-complete.js component could be more customisable (e.g. using a class instead of an id, or the used field [name] to filter by).

## setup

install modules

```sh
npm install
```

build the project

```sh
gulp build
```

Open in a browser

```sh
web/index.html
```
